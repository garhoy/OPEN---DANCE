# OPEN-DANCE
Autors: DTSKT and garhoy

This project, developed in Python, leverages the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries to create a video game named OPEN DANCE. In this game, players aim to achieve the highest possible score by aligning their body joints with the silhouette of a stickman generated through the MediaPipe library. The game offers adjustable difficulty levels for the pose-matching challenge and allows players to set a time limit for completing each pose, enhancing both the fun and challenge of the game.
